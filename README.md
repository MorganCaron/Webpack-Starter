# Webpack-Base-Project
A Webpack Base Project which can be example for every Webpack project.

## Development

`npm run dev`
or
`npm run watch`

In this mode, if one of your files is updated, the code will be recompiled so you don't have to run the full build manually.

## Production

`npm run prod`
or
`npm run build`

In this mode, the files will be generated in the `/dist` directory and automatically included in the index.html file.
